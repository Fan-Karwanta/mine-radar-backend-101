The subject operation at Purok 6, Brgy. San Jose, Lipa City is apparently a land development activity confined within a private property owned by a certain RL Umali (Latitude: 13.925684°, Longitude: 121.191510°).  The materials extracted from the area were being transported to another project site owned by the same. Interviews with barangay officials and the site caretaker affirmed that the project is non-commercial in nature and do not involve hauling of earth materials outside barangay limits.

2.        In Barangay Tipacan, barangay officials and residents refuted the alleged presence of hauling operations or similar activities. No heavy equipment or truck movements were observed in the vicinity of the area. Accessibility constraints of the area also suggest that the same is implausible to accommodate high-frequency hauling, i.e., the alleged movement of over 100 trucks.

3.        No pertinent permits were issued by the Provincial Government-Environment and Natural Resources Office of Batangas, City Environment and Natural Resources Office of Lipa, and the City Engineering Office of Lipa that allow the conduct of the subject activities.

4.        It may also be recalled that this Office issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) dated 18 January 2024 to Rumali Land Corporation (RLC) for the extraction, removal and/or disposition of minerals or mineral products, i.e., filling materials, in Barangay San Jose, Lipa City without a valid permit or authority.
